                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">As a bonus for reaching your workout goals, focus on small treats that aren’t food. For example, you could go to a concert, get a manicure, or buy a pair of shoes you like.

                        Even better, focus on how getting fitter would benefit your life. Do you want more energy? Better sleep? To be in shape for an active vacation halfway around the world? Or cross the finish line at a race, or even take home a medal?
                        
                        It’s all possible if you push yourself just a bit further, over and over..</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">A good way to build muscle mass or burn calories is to make it a habit to switch up your workout -- especially when you notice that your current plan has become comfy. It keeps you on your toes.

                        You may have gotten so used to your routine that it’s simply too easy now. To get faster or stronger, or just beat boredom, it may be time to change things up. It could be the key to turning your walks into jogs, lifting heavier weights, or swimming faster than you might have thought you ever would.</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Using your weight and gender, fitness devices can calculate the calories you burn in a day. The harder you exercise and the more you move throughout the day, the more calories you burn.

                        Some devices only record the calories you burn during exercise. Others record activity all day, like washing dishes, folding laundry, and sleeping.
                        
                        Look for devices that ask for your weight and gender to get the most accurate results..</p>

                    <h2 class="text-lg text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-4">Risk Factors for Heat Exhaustion</h2>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Heat exhaustion is strongly related to the heat index, which is a measurement of how hot you feel when the effects of relative humidity and air temperature are combined. A relative humidity of 60% or more hampers sweat evaporation, which hinders your body's ability to cool itself.

                    The risk of heat-related illness dramatically increases when the heat index climbs to 90 degrees or more. So it's important -- especially during heat waves -- to pay attention to the reported heat index, and also to remember that the heat index is even higher when you are standing in full sunshine.></p>
