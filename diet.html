                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
                   <li>1: The bulk phase – the big feed. Bulk it out then lean up with a cut.</li> 
                  <li> 2: To smash the bulk phase, you need to train like you mean it and feed like you need it. </li>
                  <li> 3: Bulking isn’t about eating as much, of whatever you want. It’s about feeding the muscle growth. Check out our top nutrition tips to support your bulking diet.</li>

                Packing on lean muscle is tough for even the most seasoned athlete. Not only does your training have to be strict and well-structured around hypertrophy, your diet also needs to support your body as it grows. 
                
                To help themselves grow, most bodybuilders will perform a bulking and cutting cycle. The bulking stage focuses on packing on as much mass as possible. Time frames vary, but the plan below is for a four-week bulk – perfect for adding extra mass before a holiday.
                
                However, to pack on size you need to be eating healthy food, and a lot of it. To help, use an online calorie calculator to work out what your calorie ‘maintenance’ is – which is the calorie intake you need to eat each day to maintain your weight. This will vary based on your height, weight, age and activity status. Typically, the guidelines state 2500 calories for men and 2000 calories for women. But in addition, you’ll need to add extra calories to ensure that you are feeding the growth. You should start with a surplus of +20%, (approximately 500 calories). 
                
                When you’re eating a surplus, your body will be able to use the extra energy (carbohydrate, protein and fat) to train harder and build muscle. An increase in calories goes hand-in-hand with an increase in muscle mass – but only if you eat the right food, i.e. packing in the protein.
